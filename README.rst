Welcome to TaskBuster's documentation!
======================================

This is an awesome **Django Project Boilerplate**!!

With this code you can start a *complex* Django Project 
very quickly, with just a few steps!

Updated for Django 1.8 and Python 3!

Some of the TaskBuster Django Project Boilerplate functionalities are:

- **different virtual environments** for developing, testing and production
- **Internationalization** and **localization** to support different languages
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Boilerplate**
- Template Inheritance
- Functional **tests**
- robots.txt and humans.txt configured

Moreover, you can learn how to create this boilerplate **step by step**
in http://marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial. There you can learn, step by step, how 
TaskBuster has been done, and even do it yourself if you want to!!

To start using the Boilerplate, check out the requirements and the quick start guide!

Requirements
============

The requirements necessary to use this Django Project Boilerplate are:

- **python3** and **pip3**
- **virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper**
- **Firefox** (to use Selenium's Webdriver in functional Tests)
- **GNU gettext** (to use Internationalization)

If you don't have the first two requirements, you may find this 
post useful: http://www.marinamele.com/2014/07/install-python3-on-mac-os-x-and-use-virtualenv-and-virtualenvwrapper.html

You can download Firefox from the official web page: https://www.mozilla.org

And if you don't have GNU gettext, check this http://marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/internationalization-localization-languages-time-zones


Quick Start Guide
=================

This Boilerplate comes with a script, tbsteup.sh, to configure the Django Project Template. See https://github.com/webanz/taskbuster-setup for more information about how to use it.

Here are the details of the manual installation and configuration:

Download TaskBuster Django Project Boilerplate
----------------------------------------------

First, you need to download the BoilerPlate from GitHub, as a zip file or using your terminal::

    $ git clone git://github.com/mineta/taskbuster-boilerplate.git

This will download the repository in your current direcotry.

Secret Django Key
-----------------

This boilerplate has the **DJANGO_KEY** setting variable hidden. 

You can generate your DJANGO_KEY http://www.miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator

Keep reading to include your new Django key into your project.

Project Name
------------

This project is named *TaskBuster*, so if you are using this 
Boilerplate to create your own project, you'll have to change 
the name in a few places:

 - *taskbuster_project* **folder** (your top project container)
 - *taskbuster_project/taskbuster* **folder** (your project name)
 - virtual environment names: **tb_dev** and **tb_test** (name them whatever you want)
 - in virtual environments **postactivate** files (see section below), you have to change **taskbuster.settings.development** for your **projectname.settings.development**. Same works for the testing environment.
 - in the **TaskBuster.sublime-project** and **TaskBuster.sublime-workspace** files. You should open the TaskBuster.sublime-project with Sublime Text and save it with another name.
 - in *taskbuster_project/taskbuster* edit the file **wsgi.py** and change **"taskbuster.settings"** accordingly.
 - in *taskbuster_project/taskbuster/settings* edit the **base.py** file and change the declarations of **ROOT_URLCONF** and **WSGI_APPLICATION**
 - in taskbuster_project edit manage.py file and change os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "taskbuster.settings") 


Virtual environments and Settings Files
---------------------------------------

First, you must know your Python 3 path::

    $ which python3

which is something similar to /usr/local/bin/python3.

Next, create a Development virtual environment with Python 3 installed::

    $ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 tb_dev

where you might need to change it with your python path.

Go to the virtual environment folder with::

    $ cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin

and edit the postactivate file::

    $ vi postactivate

You must add the lines: ::

    export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="taskbuster.settings.development"
    export SECRET_KEY="your_secret_django_key"

with your project name and your own secret key.

Next, edit the **predeactivate** file and add the line::

    unset SECRET_KEY

Repeat the last steps for your testing environment::

    $ mkvirtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3 tb_test
    $ cd $VIRTUAL_ENV/bin
    $ vi postactivate

where you have to add the lines::

    export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="taskbuster.settings.testing"
    export SECRET_KEY="your_secret_django_key"

and in the predeactivate file::

    unset SECRET_KEY

Next, install the packages in each environment::

    $ workon tb_dev
    $ pip install -r requirements/development.txt
    $ workon tb_test
    $ pip install -r requirements/testing.txt

Next, apply the basic migrations::

    $ python manage.py validate
    $ python manage.py migrate

And check that everything works by starting the server::

    $ python manage.py runserver
    


Internationalization and Localization
-------------------------------------

Settings
********

The default language for this Project is **English**, and we use internatinalization to translate the text into Catalan.

If you want to change the translation language, or include a new one, you just need to modify the **LANGUAGES** variable in the file *settings/base.py*. The language codes that define each language can be found href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms533052(v=vs.85).aspx

For example, if you want to use German you should include::

    LANGUAGES = (
        ...
        'de', _("German"),
        ...
    )

You can also specify a dialect, like Luxembourg's German with::

    LANGUAGES = (
        ...
        'de-lu', _("Luxemburg's German"),
        ...
    )

Note: the name inside the translation function _("") is the language name in the default language (English).

More information in the http://marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/internationalization-localization-languages-time-zones


Translation
***********

Go to the terminal, inside the taskbuster_project folder and create the files to translate with::

    $ python manage.py makemessages -l ca

change the language "ca" for your selected language.

Next, go to the locale folder of your language::

    $ cd taskbuster/locale/ca/LC_MESSAGES

where taskbuster is your project folder. You have to edit the file *django.po* and translate the strings. You can find more information about how to translate the strings href="http://marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial/internationalization-localization-languages-time-zones#inter-translation

Once the translation is done, compile your messages with::

    $ python manage.py compilemessages -l ca



Tests
*****

If you changed the default languages (English and Catalan), you need to update your Tests to make sure the translation works correctly. Open the file *functional_tests/test_all_users.py*:

- in **test_internationalization**, update your languages with the translation of title text, here "Welcome to TaskBuster!"
- in **test_localization**, update your languages.



Useful commands

    $ python manage.py compilemessages -l ca

Using tbsetup.sh 
----------------

tbsetup.sh can be used to rename and adjsut the template.
